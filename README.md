# Shared Digital Memory Project

Welcome to the Shared Digital Memory project, a social experiment to accumulate, refine, and share knowledge. This is a text-focused, git-powered method of organizing not only your own knowledge, but extending it with knowledge other people have shared.

## The Basic Concepts
You create one (or more) git-based "memory" repositories. You fill it with notes, things you've learned, stuff you want to keep. You organize it all with multiple tags in a way that creates threads of memory hints to help you find it later.

You can keep a memory repository total private, share it with a few friends, or open it to the whole world.

## Getting Started
* Fork repo (or create your own.)

## Rules
* Never rename a memory file, because it will break anything linked to it
